//Title: Children
//Author: Ryan Kingslien

Because it is nighttime, they have dimmed the lights & now the children
must sleep, swaying their dark
sea tumble hair among the surge of white sheets. Their mind a latticework
Of imagination & shifting constellations.

The Parents have unrolled & loosed from their plastic day. Tomorrow’s
soccer game & acting class
secreted away behind the firmament of adulthood that separates
the child from themselves.

The evening’s ritual, teeth combing & tongue champing before the mirror,
the inhaler & the pill is over.
The long back, down, up, forward pageantry of the child’s parading
to bed, is over.

The parents drift past the door of the daughter whose Lululemons, towels, 
paint tubes, small canvases
& stuffed animals lay sea tossed among the furniture, walls & floors 
& whose wild hair waves

& breaks against her mother & past the door of the son whose girl-heart & play, play, 
play betray his father’s good 
intentioned plan to form a man with his bare hands, with thumb-swept cheekbones, 
& fist dragged shoulders.

The parents hold onto their Albuteral, Claritin, Epi-pens, Benadryl & nebulizer
& chart by their constellations
Of astronaut, doctor, engineer, lawyer, pediatrician & author. But the children
have not yet shut

their eyes and, if you listen carefully enough, you can hear, as sleep gently
rolls them up,
millions of overlapping whispered voices reciting the creed of Science Viking,
Smarties Expert, & 6 Layer Dip Maker.
